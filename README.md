Project Meaningful Careers Website

Purpose and Value:

When I was coming up with the concept of this project I remembered back to when I almost started a coaching program of my own and well it sticks with me to this day. I wanted to build a site men and women, 18 to 30 years of age that can help them find the balance they need and deserve through a caterted coaching program. This site would involve two offers one on 'Stress Managment' as this is a skill that every one needs to be in a successful career and maintain a healthy work life balance. The other offer being 'Self Discovery' as knowing what your ture desires are in life is the biggest step forward towards making them a reality.

So what I wanted to bring was a way for those in the target of early to mid career a offering that can get them in the fast lane to ensureing their success and having a coach is a great way to do it and as my old mentor used to mention there is a reason most CEO's have regular meetings with a career, life, or  even bussiness coach. You need it to be and stay successful with out the burnout. So I wanted to bring something that triggers their desire to be the best they can. I feel while there is a long way to go if this idea where to come to life this is a great step forward in making them feel the way I would hope.

The Development:

The site initially was only going to be 3 pages an index.html, signup.html, and reviews.html. I started building it in a seperate repository to this one around late May 2023 right after I finished learning HTML and CSS through Code Institute. I had to remake the repository as the main one I felt had way to large of a space between commits and I wasn't quite happy with that I felt it made it difficult to follow the changes. The reason between those commits was I was picking up 10-15 minute coding sessions between varrious other tasks in my daily work-life routine. I established the core of the page got it roughly to where I wanted it and looked at the commits and went this is unacceptable to my standards.

So I then went back to make the new repository and did my best to replicate the proccess of building the site to nearly identical to the original. So some commits may appear to be made in rapid succession this is due to the code already existing in the other repository and being brought over to the new one but in smaller incriments to do proper commits. Once that was completed I continued to make changes.

What I would do diffrently in the future:

I would make this a fully functioning site including a fully funtioning form not just a page swap to say thanks while doing absolutly nothing. Do a more mobile first aproach whilst I did start that way I don't feel I did wnough. The page layouts could be simpler/flow better. After seeing some other works on reviews/testimonials I would like a more interactive version which you see one at a time and interact to view more.
