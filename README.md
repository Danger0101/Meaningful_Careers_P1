## Testing
### How I tested
- Google Chrome (various resolutions)
- Samsung A41 Phone
- Tablet

### bugs encountered
- Hero Image not being responsive in a good way was zooming in weird and making the image basically a tiny fraction of the window. Went through a few diffrent varriations of this and wiht the help of my mentor figured out the best solution and I really love how it turned out.
- A few typos and duplicate enteries in the CSS code which was an easy fix as just needed to correct typos and combine the enteries
- Accidentally deleted a body tag on index.html
- Whilst learning the mark up in readme
