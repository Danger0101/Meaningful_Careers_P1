## Features
### Navbar

![Screencap reviews.html showcasing navbar dropdown](assets/images/meaningfulcareersreadmeimg/navbar.png)

- The navigation is an animated hamburger icon from fontawesome using css logic on a hidden check box when checked it opens and animates the dropdown menu. To keep it simple and uniform it remains the same at all page sizes and even on all pages it never changes so you can find what your looking for with ease. You can see me test the navbar [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/hkMueNmEGPg?feature=share).

### offerings.html

- This page is an information page about the two coaching offers provided by 'Meaningful Careers' and is meant to give a more in-depth idea as to what each offer will provide them should the pursue the coaching offer further.

---
### signup.html

![Screencap signup.html](assets/images/meaningfulcareersreadmeimg/meaningful_signup.png)

- For those who feel the desire to proceed further into getting a coaching session we have a signup page. Theoretically this is where the magic starts to happen. A user would input all the information on this page and register their interest and this will go to a database and pop up to one of the coaches to give the prospect a call or email. With more information about the coaching offer of their choosing. This is where the coach will walk them through the offering and pitch them on it in a way that works for them. (at this time it just redirects to thankyou.html)

### reviews.html

![Screencap reviews.html 1](assets/images/meaningfulcareersreadmeimg/meaningful_reviews.png)

- A page to show case past experiences of those who have used the coaching offer and wished to leave a review. This adds more validity and makes the company more reputable to future prospects. As well as allow them to share in the success of others and see the changes its made.

### thankyou.html

![Screencap thankyou.html](assets/images/meaningfulcareersreadmeimg/meaningful_thanks.png)

- This is the landing page after a user submits their form ideally once JavaScript would be added this would change a good bit from this state I would like it to propagate a more personalized message to the user and provide them an estimate time till they can receive the call or a link to book a call.

### bugs encountered
- Hero Image not being responsive in a good way was zooming in weird and making the image basically a tiny fraction of the window. Went through a few different variations of this and with the help of my mentor figured out the best solution and I really love how it turned out.
- A few typos and duplicate entries in the CSS code which was an easy fix as just needed to correct typos and combine the entries
- Accidentally deleted a body tag on index.html so added it back in,
- No other bugs have been indentified.
